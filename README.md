# config
my personal arch and sway config files 
this repo has my dotfiles that i use, you can copy them and use them if you want to.
the dependencies that you need are : 
grim dunst waybar brightnessctl pamixer swaylock bemenu gammastep alacritty wl-clipboard sway
a functional arch system is enough
